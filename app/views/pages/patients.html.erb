	<h2>Allergy symptoms and further questions</h2>
	<p>Please write down any questions or concerns prior to your visit so that they can be addressed during your visit. Dr. Daftary will discuss your current allergy/asthma symptoms and past medical history.</p>
	
	<h2>During your visit with Dr. Daftary</h2>
	
	<p>Several questions will be asked regarding you home and work environment to determine if any changes should be made to your environment to decrease your exposure to allergens. Dr. Daftary will perform an exam to look at your ears, eyes, nose, throat and skin and listen to your heart and lungs.</p>
	
	<p>Dr. Daftary may recommend skin allergy testing for you to help her evaluate which allergens may be making you sick. We test for environmental allergens such as trees, grasses, weeds, molds, house dust and dust mites as well as selected food testing. Most skin testing is done on the back and we use a plastic device to apply the allergy serum to your back. The testing device does not break the skin and no bleeding is involved. The serum remains on your back for 20 minutes before being read and you may notice an itching sensation to some areas. Dr. Daftary will then read the testing on your back and discuss which allergens you are most allergic to.</p>
	
	<p>If you have problems with wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath or chest tightness, Dr. Daftary will evaluate your lung function by having you blow into a mouthpiece several times.</p>
	
	<p>Depending on your allergy testing results and pulmonary results, Dr. Daftary will recommend environmental controls, medications to relieve your symptoms and may recommend that you start on allergy injections to decrease your sensitivity to allergens. One of our nurses will also review ways to decrease your exposure to allergens in your home and work environment. </p>
	
	<h2>At your next appointments</h2>
	
	<p>During your follow-up visits, retesting of allergens or sick visits you will be cared for by either Dr. Daftary or the Nurse Practitioner, Patricia Tatum.</p>
	
	<h2>We look forward to seeing you at first visit!</h2>
