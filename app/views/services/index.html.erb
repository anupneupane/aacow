<p>Read further to investigate what a Board Certified allergist like Allergy and Asthma Care of Wacoâ€™s Dr. Daftary can help you with.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Allergists are able to diagnose patients accurately with respect to having allergic, non-allergic or mixed nasal symptoms and breathing difficulties. Appropriate therapy can therefore be recommended in consideration with patient needs.</li>
	<li>Allergists can customize immunotherapy (allergy injection serum), which in studies has shown to be more effective than low dose injections often used by general practice physicians who practice allergy.</li>
	<li>Allergists recommend avoidance measures, which is an important part in the overall prevention and treatment of allergy.</li>
	<li>Allergists improve quality of life and reduce health care costs.</li>
	<li>Allergists are internists, pediatricians or medical/pediatric physicians who do a subspecialty fellowship in allergy and immunology.</li>
</ul>
